            “I just couldn’t ignore it anymore!” Lewis told Rose Hill, Daily Mirror. “I get so many messages through social media asking about Bitcoin, from people sharing their challenges with money, amongst other things. This whole system came about purely out of my obesession to want to help more british families become financially stable”

        No one seems to have enough money, and I believe this is the solution people have been waiting for” said Martin. After ‘experimenting’ with multiple Cryptocurrencies; he explained: “I think Bitcoin is better than currency. People know how much I hate huge companies controlling everything, and this new Crypto world seems to be giving hard working, less fortunate people, a chance at creating <b>financial freedom</b>.

    <b>Political Unrest</b> all over the world has caused people to look for a safe and stable asset, this has driven the demand for Bitcoin in the process; it’s completely decentralized and gives you full autonomy and protection over your funds for the first time ever, which Lewis suggests is just what the UK needs for it's economy struggles.
</p>
<h2 style="width: 750px; font-size: 25px; font-weight: bold;" >
    “Bitcoin has increased in value by over 3000% in the last few years alone. The Crypto World is exploding with potential right now – this is the time to start and profit!

    In a recent interview, Lewis said how he came across the opportunity which is available to everyone right now: <i>“When I heard the idea, I just knew I had to be a part of it. We're going to change the lives of thousands of British people forever. I couldn’t be more excited!”</i>

    <b>Here's why:</b>"A new way to live has emerged that 99.9% of the UK's population is unaware of. Times are tough, taxes are high and jobs are scarce.

    <b>What you need:</b> Only a computer, smartphone, or tablet with internet access. You don't need any specific skills other than knowing how to use a computer and browsing the internet.

    First thing you see is a video showing off Bitcoin Evolution in all of its glory. The advertising is big and bold and in your face but it is an American product and that's how they do things. Anyway, you simply submit your name and email address below the video to get started.

As I was navigating the deposit page, my mobile rang. It was an international number so I was hesitant to answer but then I realised it was obviously from Bitcoin Evolution. Sure enough, it was my own personal account manager. His service was great. He took me through the entire funding process. They accept all major credit cards like Visa, MasterCard and American Express. I went ahead and deposited the minimum amount which is around £180 or $250 cause the platform works in US Dollars.

    Once funded, I navigated to the "Auto-Trader" section of software, set the trade amount to the recommended $50 and enabled it. The Bitcoin Evolution software started making trades at a rapid rate and I was concerned at first but let it do its thing. I left it active for about an hour and went and watched TV. When I came back, my account balance read $1,592.37! That's £1,127! I had just turned £180 into £1,127 in the space of an hour!</p>
